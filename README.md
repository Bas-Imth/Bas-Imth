### 'Allo ðŸ‘‹

My name is Bas "Sho" Imth  
_Writing is not my profession.
Coding, however._

Something short about me:

- I'm the Tyrant of a community called [Constructive Tyranny](https://tyrant.gg)
- I'm a ~~student~~ turns out I am a working man now.
- Probably a Unix fanatic
- Is considered being an A.I
- Went from being a student to being the architect of multiple business critcal environments in three weeks.
  - Got asked to write a program to solve a mission critical issue for a major medical facility.
    - And did so in a few days.  
      - And I only just got started.
